    m_Localized: It's really beautiful here. So many stars in the night sky.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468864
    m_Localized: It's kind of surprising to see stars in LA, right?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468865
    m_Localized: Yeah, it feels a bit like we're in a dream.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468866
    m_Localized: Life is made up of moments like this. Once they pass, they feel
      like a fantasy.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468867
    m_Localized: But sometimes I just want to stay in that fantasy.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468868
    m_Localized: Yeah. But... eventually, we have to come back to reality.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468869
    m_Localized: Reality, huh... Your music seems pretty far from reality, doesn't
      it?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468870
    m_Localized: Music is my reality. Even if everything else falls apart, music
      will still be there.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468871
    m_Localized: You're just like me. Acting feels like that to me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468872
    m_Localized: I guess we're both crazy about art.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466706468873
    m_Localized: So what if we're crazy? At least we're living for ourselves.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466710663168
    m_Localized: Yeah, that's what matters. Living by our standards, not someone
      else's.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466710663169
    m_Localized: But sometimes I get anxious. I'm not always sure if this is the
      right path.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466710663170
    m_Localized: Everyone feels like that sometimes. In those moments, you just keep
      moving forward. Don't stop.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466710663171
    m_Localized: Do you think you'll be happy if you keep going down this path?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466710663172
    m_Localized: Well... I can't be sure. But I believe it's worth trying.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466710663173
    m_Localized: Then, we'll keep trying. Together.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110466710663174
    m_Localized: Together... Yeah, I like that.
