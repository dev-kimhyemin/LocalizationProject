    m_Localized: You really seem to love the piano.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447306559488
    m_Localized: Of course. I couldn't live without it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447306559489
    m_Localized: "What about other things? Don\u2019t you feel like you have to give
      something up sometimes?"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447306559490
    m_Localized: Hmm... I've never really felt like I had to give something up. It
      just feels like I'm naturally on this path.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753792
    m_Localized: Sometimes I envy how certain you are. I keep getting lost.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753793
    m_Localized: Why are you so confused?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753794
    m_Localized: I don't know... It feels like the world is telling me, "This isn't
      going to work."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753795
    m_Localized: The world has it wrong. You can do it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753796
    m_Localized: Thanks. But sometimes... it's hard to even believe in myself.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753797
    m_Localized: Then I'll believe in you. You just believe in me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753798
    m_Localized: If only it were that simple.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753799
    m_Localized: Maybe it is simple. We're the ones who make it complicated.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753800
    m_Localized: You're probably right. But I'm used to things being complicated.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753801
    m_Localized: Then just find a way to be happy while living a complicated life.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753802
    m_Localized: Do you think that's possible?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753803
    m_Localized: Why not? We create the world around us.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753804
    m_Localized: Hearing that... gives me a bit of courage.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753805
    m_Localized: "Then that\u2019s enough. Life is really just about saying, \"Let\u2019s
      give it a shot,\" isn\u2019t it?"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753806
    m_Localized: So, should we give it a shot?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753807
    m_Localized: Of course. There's no reason not to.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 447310753808
    m_Localized: Then I'll... give it a shot with you.
